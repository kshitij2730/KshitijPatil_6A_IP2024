<h1 style="text-align: center"><u>What is India's contributions towards satellite technology?</u></h1>
<p>Indian National Satellite System (INSAT)
1-INSAT is one of the most important satellite systems in India. Launched in 1983, it is a series of multipurpose geostationary satellites that provide services in telecommunications, broadcasting, meteorology, and search and rescue operations. It has significantly contributed to improving communication networks, television broadcasting, and disaster warning systems in India.
The INSAT-3DR, launched in 2016, provided advanced weather monitoring capabilities and also assisted in disaster management and communications.<br>
 2-Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) Satellites
The IRS program, initiated in 1988, was India's first series of earth observation satellites. These satellites have been instrumental in mapping land use, managing natural resources, agriculture, urban planning, and disaster monitoring.
The Cartos at series and Resources at series, which are a part of the IRS program, offer high-resolution imagery and other earth observation data critical for Indiaâ€™s development.<br>
3-Communication Satellites
India has developed a range of communication satellites under the GSAT (Geo-Stationary Satellite) series. These satellites, such as GSAT-10, GSAT-30, and GSAT-19, support telecommunication, broadcasting, broadband services, and Internet connectivity.
These satellites play a critical role in expanding India's communication infrastructure, particularly in rural and remote areas.<br>
THESE ARE THE SATELITE INDIA HAS CONTRIBUTED.</P>
