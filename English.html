<p>Ila Sachani, from Moti Vavdi village in Bhavnagar, Gujarat, is known for her vibrant embroidery creations.<br>
Despite being born with hands that couldn’t be used conventionally, Ila’s mother and grandmother, skilled in Kathiawar embroidery, taught her to embroider using her feet.<br>
With determination, Ila mastered threading needles and learned various embroidery styles beyond Gujarat.<br>
Initially creating designs for family and friends, Ila’s talent soon gained local admiration and government recognition.<br>
Her work was showcased at state exhibitions, leading to national acclaim and awards, including the President’s Medal.<br>
Through her art, Ila not only found financial independence but also inspired others to overcome challenges with perseverance and positivity.<br>
 Her embroidery, crafted with her feet, exemplifies how art transcends physical limitations to touch hearts and souls.<br></p>
